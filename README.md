# Psychologist


Current webpage represents essential information about specialist and his consultations. Here I used some animations to make page look less static. It is made like landing focusing on one main button: make an appointment. After clicking you’ll be asked the way you want to contact the psychologist. No JS was needed, because the purpose of this page is to represent given information. It’s responsive as well.
